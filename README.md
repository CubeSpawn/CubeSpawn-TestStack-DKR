CubeSpawn Control framework

As implementer vie Docker microservices architecture

as of 7/1/2016 the first two of three examples are completed.

Status:

Instructions for the ROS talker/listerner tutorial run on a conventional Ubuntu install -tested, working

Instructions for the ROS talker/listener tutorial run as 3 docker instances off one image using the Docker network -tested, working

Intructions for the ROS talker/listener tutorial implemented as 3 docker instances run from a docker_compose.yml file - YAML problems, not working yet

Next steps

Once functional, a roscore/Rviz environment will be built, and the first machine model will be added.
